# 🔺 Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## 🧪 Program

```python
n = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))

for i in range(n):
    print(" " * (n - i), end="")

    for j in range(i + 1):
        value = 1
        for k in range(j):
            value = value * (i - k) // (k + 1)

        print(value, end=" ")

    print()
```

## Sample Output


```text
Enter the number of rows: 5
     1 
    1 1 
   1 2 1 
  1 3 3 1 
 1 4 6 4 1
```

## Result
Thus, the Python program successfully generates Pascal's Triangle for the number of rows entered by the user.
